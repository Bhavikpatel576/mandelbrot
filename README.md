# Mandelbrot
The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers (denoted at c) for which the function {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c} does not diverge when enumerated on from z = 0 to z -> âˆž. 

## Description
At the core of the program, each pixel is configured to be on a point within the complex plane and then run against the escape time algorithm to determine if the point converges or diverges. Each event is represented by a partiuclar color. The former being a value between 0-255 RBG decimal value dependent on the number of iterations to convergence, and the latter being color 0 (black). 

## Details and Code
The program leverages the MinilibX library in order create graphics renderings.
